# RemoteSensing_Landcover
Analyzing land cover types through remote sensing

Motivation: Using Remote Sensing Data to Investigate Land Cover in California


About:
With the increased use and advancements of Satellite Imagery and
algorithms, researchers and citizen scientists can now monitor the
impacts of human activities on our natural landscapes. Impacts include
deforestation, urban expansion, overpopulation, pollution, extraction,
and burning fossil fuels. Through the application of remote sensing
techniques, spectral indices combined with specific spectral bands
highlight various land cover characteristics, such as vegetation health,
water content, and soil properties. In order to investigate land cover,
this project will classify remotely sensed imagery into land cover
classes through supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised
approaches use training data labeled by the user, whereas unsupervised
approaches use algorithms to create groups which are identified by the
user afterward.
